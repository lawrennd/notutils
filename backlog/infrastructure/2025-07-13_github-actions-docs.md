# Task: Set up GitHub Actions for documentation compilation

## Description

Implement a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically build the project documentation (using Sphinx) on every push and pull request. This ensures that documentation is always up-to-date, build errors are caught early, and artifacts are available for review.

The workflow should:
- Build documentation using Sphinx and Poetry
- Run on every push to main and on pull requests
- Upload built documentation as an artifact
- Optionally deploy documentation to GitHub Pages or another hosting service
- Cache dependencies for faster builds
- Provide clear feedback on build status and errors

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] GitHub Actions workflow file created in `.github/workflows/`
- [x] Documentation builds automatically on push to main branch
- [x] Documentation builds automatically on pull requests
- [x] Build artifacts uploaded for review
- [x] Build errors reported in GitHub interface
- [x] Dependencies cached for faster builds
- [x] Workflow runs in under 5 minutes
- [x] Optionally: Documentation deployed to GitHub Pages

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Approach
1. **Workflow Structure**:
   - Use `ubuntu-latest` as the runner
   - Set up Python matrix if needed
   - Use Poetry for dependency management

2. **Build Execution**:
   - Install dependencies using Poetry
   - Build documentation using Sphinx (`make html` or `sphinx-build`)
   - Upload HTML build as artifact

3. **Optional Deployment**:
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages using `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages` or similar

4. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Cache Poetry dependencies
   - Cache Sphinx build output if needed

### Dependencies
- Requires implementation of CIP-0001 (Comprehensive Code Documentation)
- Sphinx and related packages must be added to dev dependencies
- Documentation source must be present in `docs/`

### Configuration Files Needed
- `.github/workflows/docs.yml` - Main documentation workflow
- `pyproject.toml` - Update with Sphinx dependencies
- `docs/` - Documentation source directory
